      <p>It all started one rainy day in 1959 when our founder Captain Sundaram couldn't just walk away from the two pups struggling to stay afloat in the flooded roads of T Nagar. He took them home and that gesture marked the beginning of Blue Cross, the animal shelter in his house which at one stage had 60 cats, dogs, goats, bandicoots and also a pair of baby mongooses!

Captain Sundaram, born on April 22nd, 1916, had always wanted to care for animals. In his own words, "God had given me so much that I thought I ought to do something in return. There are so many charitable institutions for human beings, but so few for animals. "With full-fledged support from his family (his wife Usha and the children built the first few kennels with their own hands), they were soon rescuing and sheltering animals in their T Nagar residence.

By March 1960, a small group of four people - Captain Sundaram, Mrs Usha Sundaram, their son Chinny Krishna, and Mr D. Deivasigamoni, then Executive Committee member of the Madras SPCA and Mr. Krishnamurthy, started an organisation called the Animal Aid Association which was mainly intended to help animals injured in accidents. In the next few years, this group slowly expanded and on April 1, 1964, the group was registered as the Blue Cross of India.

The founding members were Captain Sundaram, Usha Sundaram, Sundari Nataraj, D. Deivasigamoni, T. V. Chandrasekhar, Kamakshi Krishnamoorti, S. Chinny Krishna, Suresh Sundaram, and S. Vijayalakshmi.

When the Blue Cross celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2014, five of the original nine founders - Sundari Nataraj, T. V. Chandrasekhar, Chinny Krishna, Suresh Sundaram and S. Vijayalakshmi joined in the celebrations! Chandrasekhar was 90 and Sundari Nataraj was 92! Today, in July 2017, the last three are still actively involved in animal welfare work and the Blue Cross of India with Dr. S. Chinny Krishna designated as Chairman Emeritus of the organisation of which he was the Chairman of from 2000 to 2010.

The Blue Cross has been fortunate in having a group of professionals who gave freely of their time and efforts on a purely honorary basis, thus ensuring that every rupee received by us went into directly helping animals without any of it being eroded by administrative purposes. Till 1997, only the veterinary doctors and one driver were paid with all other work being done by volunteers.

In November 1997, we moved to our present premises on Velachery Road, Guindy - a plot of land we purchased from the Government of Tamil Nadu. Our other two centres are Kunnam in Kanchipuram District and Toducadu in Tiruvallur District. The Kunnam land was donated by Mr. Sujith Joseph and were set up by us in 1999 and 2000 respectively.
